To build this project, you must clone it into your IDE of choice as a Maven Project. I personally use Eclipse so I would either download the zip folder, extract it, and go to File -> Import -> Existing Maven Projects -> Browse and Find the project -> Finish OR I would clone it into my workspace and import it into Eclipse using the same steps.

JDK 8 is the minimum required to successfully compile the project. 

There is NO main method to run the project from. Only the domain classes and accompanying tests.
